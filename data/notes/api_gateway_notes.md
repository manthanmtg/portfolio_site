# API Gateway Notes

## Key Concepts
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable communication between software applications  
- API Gateway acts as a central intermediary between clients and backend services 
- Used heavily in microservices architecture for managing multiple services

## Key Components

1. **Request Processing**
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Rate Limiting
   - Request Validation
   - Request Transformation

2. **Routing & Load Balancing**
   - Service Discovery
   - Load Distribution
   - Circuit Breaking
   - Failover Handling

3. **Response Handling**
   - Response Transformation
   - Caching
   - Compression
   - Error Handling

## Core Features
1. Authentication & Authorization
  - Verifies user identity using tokens/API keys
  - Controls access permissions

2. Request Management
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Load balancing across service instances
  - Request transformation for compatibility
  - Response caching to reduce latency

3. Service Intelligence
  - Service discovery for dynamic routing
  - Circuit breaking to handle failing services
  - Logging and monitoring capabilities

## Common Features

### Security
- OAuth/JWT Support
- API Key Management
- IP Whitelisting
- SSL/TLS Termination

### Monitoring
- Request/Response Logging
- Performance Metrics
- Error Tracking
- Health Checks

### Traffic Management
- Throttling
- Quota Management
- Request Prioritization
- A/B Testing Support

## Benefits
- Simplified client interactions through single entry point
- Centralized security and authentication
- Better system reliability and performance
- Easier maintenance and monitoring

## Request Flow
Gateway → Validation → Authentication → Rate Check → Transform → Route → Response → Logging

## Popular Solutions
- Kong
- AWS API Gateway
- Azure API Management
