## Notes on Concurrency vs. Parallelism

## 🔄 Overview
- Concurrency and parallelism are key concepts in system design.
- They are often misunderstood but differ significantly:
  - **Concurrency**: Managing multiple tasks by interleaving execution.
  - **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously.

## ➕ What is Concurrency?
- **Definition**: Making progress on multiple tasks at the same time by switching between them.
- **Key Points**:
  - Achieved through **threads**.
  - Utilizes rapid **context switching**.
  - Aims to maximize CPU utilization by reducing idle time.
- **Example**: Writing code while listening to music 🎵.

### ⚙️ How Concurrency Works:
1. **Context Switching**:
   - **Saving State**: Current task’s state is saved.
   - **Loading State**: Next task’s state is loaded.
   - **Rapid Switching**: Happens so quickly it appears tasks are simultaneous.
2. **Costs**:
   - **Overhead**: Context switching consumes time and resources.
   - **Performance Impact**: Excessive switching can degrade efficiency.

### 🔧 Real-World Examples of Concurrency:
1. **Web Browsers** 🔤:
   - Rendering pages.
   - Fetching resources.
   - Responding to user actions.
2. **Web Servers** 🔧:
   - Handling multiple client requests via threads or async I/O.
3. **Chat Applications** 💬:
   - Processing incoming/outgoing messages.
   - Updating UI in real time.
4. **Video Games** 🎮:
   - Rendering graphics, user inputs, physics simulation, and audio simultaneously.

## ➕ What is Parallelism?
- **Definition**: Executing multiple tasks or subtasks at the same time.
- **Key Points**:
  - Tasks are divided into smaller **independent subtasks**.
  - Subtasks are processed simultaneously using multiple cores or GPUs.
  - Aims to achieve true simultaneous execution.
- **Example**: Cooking with multiple chefs in a kitchen 🍲.

### ⚙️ How Parallelism Works:
1. **Task Division**: Split tasks into independent parts.
2. **Task Assignment**: Assign parts to separate processing units (e.g., cores).
3. **Simultaneous Execution**: Subtasks processed in parallel.
4. **Result Aggregation**: Combine results into final output.

### 🔧 Real-World Examples of Parallelism:
1. **Machine Learning** 🤖:
   - Training on datasets divided across GPUs or CPU cores.
2. **Video Rendering** 🎥:
   - Processing frames simultaneously for faster results.
3. **Web Crawlers** 🔎:
   - Fetching data from multiple websites in parallel.
4. **Big Data Processing** 📊:
   - Frameworks like Apache Spark distribute tasks across clusters.
5. **Scientific Simulations** ⚛️:
   - Weather modeling or molecular simulations.

## 🔗 Combining Concurrency and Parallelism

### ⚪ Concurrent, Not Parallel:
- **Description**: Multiple tasks progress simultaneously but not executed simultaneously.
- **Example**: Single-core CPU rapidly switching between tasks.

### ⚪ Parallel, Not Concurrent:
- **Description**: Single task divided into subtasks, executed simultaneously on separate cores.
- **Example**: Video rendering without overlapping tasks.

### ⚪ Neither Concurrent Nor Parallel:
- **Description**: Tasks executed sequentially, one after another.
- **Example**: Single-core CPU processing tasks one at a time.

### ⚪ Concurrent and Parallel:
- **Description**: Multiple tasks progress simultaneously with subtasks executed in parallel.
- **Example**: Multi-core CPU running subtasks both concurrently and in parallel.

---

## 🔺 Summary:
- **Concurrency**: Efficient task switching to maximize CPU utilization ⏳.
- **Parallelism**: True simultaneous execution of tasks ⚡.
- Combining both techniques often yields the best performance depending on the problem and hardware.
